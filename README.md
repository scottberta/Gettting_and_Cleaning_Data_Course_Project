# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
This repository contains the following files:

README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below)
