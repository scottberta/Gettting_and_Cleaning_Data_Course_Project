# Code Book
The data set that this code book pertains to is located in the `tidy_data.txt` file of this repository.

See the `README.md` file of this repository for information on how this data set was created.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing `Accelerometer`) were made in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing `Gyroscope`) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing `Magnitude`) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `timeDomain`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `frequencyDomain`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
